# NFT
Overview
---------
This project is a full-stack web3 development, that is built in react/javascript, solidity and CSS. The program renders a 
website, where clients can mint real estate by inputting the address and description of the house they would like to mint to
the ethereum blockchain.


Instructions
------------
1. Install metamask for chrome: https://metamask.io/download.html
2. Install ganache (private blockchain for testing): https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache
3. Open ganache, do quickstart, then on the far right side of the first address click the key icon, copy the private key,
   add that private key into your meta mask to make an account and call it something like ganache testing
4. Add a custom rpc on meta mask for ganache: name it ganache network, all info for all fields is found on the top bar of your
   ganache application you have open.
5. To get the script working, type the following commands into a new terminal window...
  - git clone https://github.com/giovannivignone/NFT nft-realestate
  - cd nft-realestate
  - yarn install
  - yarn start
6. Here is the most complex part, and you will get errors with metamask if you do not do the following. In an IDE open the project. Now you are going to want to open your terminal again with cd nft-realestate, are run npm install -g truffle, then the next command you are going to want to run is truffle compile. Then run truffle migrate. You will create a new build folder. Delete the old build folder in src, and move the new one into its place.
7. Open in a chrome browser: http://localhost:3000/
8. Choose the ganache testing account in metamask which should be loaded with 100 ETH for testing, and choose the ganache 
   network you added to connect.
9. Right click the page, go down to Inspect, and then in the black window that opens, select Console from the top
10. Mint some NFTs on your fake blockchain and have fun! The transaction will appear in the console after you approve it in 
   the metamask popup!
